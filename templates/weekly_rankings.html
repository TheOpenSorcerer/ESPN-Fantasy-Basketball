<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>The code scrapes the scoreboard table from the League Scoreboard page. It then compares a team's stats for the
    whole week against the stats for every other team and computes the score. The result of all these comparisons are
    displayed in the link above for the user to see. Teams with more wins against their peers are ranked higher in the
    "Weekly Rankings".</p>
