    During the 2018-2019 fantasy season, ESPN redesigned its website. As a result, I've had to change the code for this
    application. I made these changes very quickly and so the application is not very fast, but should still work. I might write a faster/better
    program if I get the chance, but feel free to help out by cleaning things up on the GitHub repo. Also, would love to
    get your feedback on if this application helped you. My e-mail address is <a href="mailto:warrencrasta@gmail.com">warrencrasta@gmail.com</a>.

<p>An application that calculates and displays various statistics for ESPN Fantasy Basketball leagues. The
    code/application works for (public) leagues of any size that use H2H Most Cat. scoring.
