<p>Season Rankings are automatically updated everyday. In the event of a tie in the rankings, multiple teams will
appear on the same line, delimited by a comma. </p>

{% for item in rankings %}
   {{ loop.index }}. {{ item[1]|join(', ') }}<br>
{% endfor %}

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p> The code scrapes the "Season Stats" table from the League Standings page. It then compares a team's stats for the
    whole season against the stats for every other team and computes the score. The result of all these comparisons are
    displayed in the link above for the user to see. Teams with more wins against their peers are ranked higher in the
    "Season Rankings".</p>
